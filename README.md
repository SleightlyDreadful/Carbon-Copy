**Carbon Copy** is a feature-rich constraint-based clone system built for **VRChat** users and designed with performers in mind. Its features are entirely customizable and modular while optimizing parameter memory, and can be installed with one-click without any VRChat 3.0 or advanced Unity experience whatsoever.

With the earliest prototypes/teasers of the system dating back to 2020, we've spent over a year polishing these features for you...

## Available now on [gumroad](https://dreadrith.gumroad.com/)!

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Avatar doesn't have an Animator Component </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Make sure your Avatar Root with the Avatar Descriptor has an Animator on it. Most FBXs come with this by default, so this might indicate something happened to yours that needs to be fixed.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Your Avatar's Action playable layer is set as FX </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

This is an uncommon bug due to the changing of Avatars in your Animator component or the switching between Generic/Humanoid rigs while having an Avatar Descriptor. Click Fix to resolve this, and make sure to replace your custom Action layer if you had one.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Delete </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Removes Carbon Copy. 

* Deletes the CCopy World Space.
* Removes all Carbon Copy Parameters.
* Deletes all Carbon Copy layers from FX.

Note that the clean up doesn't delete assets in the Generated Assets folder as to avoid deleting any important files. It also does not remove any properties from animation clips or paths in masks that it previously added.

For a clean rollback, simply use your original assets again. Carbon Copy uses a copy of all assets so that no modification is permanent.  

</details>

<details>

### Gesture Controls

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Gesture Mapping </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

The **Gesture Control** mapping is as follows:

| Hand Gesture Layout | `LShift Left Hand` | `RShift Right Hand` |
| :------------- | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| `F2 Gesture Fist` | Invis | Freeze |
| `F6 Gesture Rock n Roll` | Mirror Radial | Mirror Vertical |
| `F7 Gesture Handgun` | Swap | Mirror Standard |
| `F8 Gesture Thumbs Up` | Mimic | Confirm |

######

To use **Jutsu Control**, the mapping is the same as the **Gesture Control** mapping above, but with two additional combo gestures to remember:

| Jutsu Function | Gesture Combination |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| `Trigger Gesture` | Both hands Victory |
| `Reset Gesture` | Both hands Rock n Roll |

Gestures will be ignored until the `Trigger Gesture` is activated. Once the `Trigger Gesture` is activated, the next corresponding gesture to the **Gesture Control** mapping will be toggled, and persist after letting go of the gesture. To clear all active **Gesture Control**s, use `Reset Gesture`

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Is Carbon Copy compatible with VRChat Quest Avatars? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**No**, as [VRChat Quest Avatars](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/quest-content-limitations) do not support Constraints at this time. Other clone systems are often not compatible either.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Is Carbon Copy compatible with Optimized Avatars? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

It is not compatible by default, but manual modifications can be made to reach [optimization standards](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/avatar-performance-ranking-system). It is possible to get down as far as Good rating, assuming you had a near Excellent rating model prior to clone generation. You would have to remove the HUD mesh, and modify the `Show Self` and `Hide Self` animation clips to matswap your body mesh to an invisible material instead of toggling the body mesh to prevent yourself from being permanently culled. Any other stat reductions are dependent on what avatar you choose to use with this system.

  <summary> <strong> Is Carbon Copy compatible with SleightlyBall/WorldPhysics? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

SleightlyBall v1.0.0 works as long as you leave the Clean Up module to remove the clone's Fixed Joints, which it does by default. However, the clone's collision will not collide properly due to the World Physics fix being in the Gesture layer instead of FX, which Carbon Copy does not duplicate properties for.
	
To resolve this, you'll have to modify the animation clip in the Gesture layer called Start Fix and duplicate this property to affect the clone's SB_Container as well. Feel free to reach out to JustSleightly in his server for further assistance with this.
	
This will be handled in an upcoming version of SleightlyBall.

  <summary> <strong> Why do my particle systems have pink/missing material references? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Carbon Copy functions by rendering itself using the renderer property on all potential meshes. This includes the Particle System Renderer module, so if you have any particle systems that dont have the Renderer module enabled, then they will end up enabled by default even if there is no material/mesh there.

To resolve this, go to any of these unused renderer modules on your particle systems and set their render mode to None.

<details>

  <summary> <strong> How do I fix No Gesture Expressions to also disable non-blendshapes (Tongues/Eyes)? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Navigate through your project files to your Avatar's Generated Assets folder for Carbon Copy and locate the animation clips for `Gesture` and `Jutsu` in the UI folder. You can add extra properties to this clip to account for resetting your non-blendshape animations.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> How do I export Carbon Copy with my commercial package? </strong> </summary>

######

You can find these generated resources at ***Save File Path**/GeneratedAssets/*. By default, this is *Assets/DreadScripts/Carbon Copy/GeneratedAssets/*.

**[Quantum](https://github.com/Link250)** - For developing the [HUD shader](https://github.com/JustSleightly/ToggleHUD) over many months with JustSleightly just for this project to combat the loss of toggle indicators in the Expressions Menu due to memory optimization
