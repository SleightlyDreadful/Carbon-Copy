**Carbon Copy** is a feature-rich constraint-based clone system built for **VRChat** users and designed with performers in mind. Its features are entirely customizable and modular while optimizing parameter memory, and can be installed with 1-click without any VRChat 3.0 or advanced Unity experience whatsoever.

With the earliest prototypes/teasers of the system dating back to 2020, we've spent over a year polishing these features for you...

## Available now at [dreadrith.com](https://www.dreadrith.com/)!

* Independently control the visibility of yourself or your clone with **Invis** and **Hide**
* Instantaneously swap visibility from yourself to your clone with **Swap**
* **Freeze** your clone or drop a frozen clone in place
* Control where your clone appears before it's visible with **Anchor**
* Pick up, grab, or **bind** your clone to different parts of your body
* Pass your clone like a spring-joint ball between your hands or orbiting around your body
* Supports custom bind targets, such as other bones, props, or even full compatibility with other systems like [this one](https://github.sleightly.dev/SleightlyBall)
* **Scale** your clone up or down to whatever % you configure
* Control whether your clone follows your movement proportionally or not on the **Y axis** or **XZ plane**
* Quick toggle between scaled and unscaled clones

######

<blockquote>

![](https://github.com/JustSleightly/SleightlyBall/raw/main/Documentation/Images/SB%20Additional%20Features.png)

######

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Ball Distance </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to include a radial puppet that adjusts the distance of the hand and head ball anchors from you by a local scale of 1 - 10x. 

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

This also affects your orbit radius, but the radius may be scaled differently than your hand anchor distance depending on your initial set radius.

If FBT Mode is enabled, this also affects foot anchors and foot orbits.

Adds one dedicated float (8 memory) to your expression parameters.

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Ball Strength </strong></summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to include a radial puppet that adjusts the strength at which the ball is attracted to its anchors.

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

Default Ball Strength can be configured under Advanced options.

Adds one dedicated float (8 memory) to your expression parameters.

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> World Constraints </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to include four toggles to world constrain your hands, head, or chest anchors independently, allowing you to pass the balls between your body and fixed points in the world. 

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

If FBT Mode is enabled, two more toggles will be included to constrain each foot anchor.

Constraining your chest anchor will cause your Chest Orbit gesture control to attract like your head/hand gesture controls rather than orbit.

Adds 0 - 6 memory to your expression parameters (See **Memory Calculations** for more details).

</details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary> <strong> World Physics </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to include three toggles to enable/disable ball collision, bounce, and gravity.

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enabling World Physics adds to your Gesture Playable layer. If these layers' order is later shifted, you must run **VRLabs' [Fix Order](https://github.com/VRLabs/VRChat-Avatars-3.0#fix-order)** script to resolve the sub-animator.

Collision is off by default, due to ball collision's ability to affect world triggers (portals, distance-based mirrors, etc).

Bounce is on by default.

Gravity is off by default.

Adds 0 - 3 memory to your expression parameters (See **Memory Calculations** for more details).

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Simple Control </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to add a toggle to switch between simplified versus advanced **Gesture Control**.
|  |  |
| :------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `Simple` | Only 'simple' gesture controls are enabled |
| `Advanced` | All seven gesture controls are enabled |

######

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

By default, Primary, Secondary, and Orbit are considered 'simple' gestures.

The definition of a 'simple' gesture can be configured from **Remap Control Gestures**.

Adds 0 - 1 memory to your expression parameters (See **Memory Calculations** for more details).

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Shoot Toggle </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to add a toggle to switch between ball throw vs ball shoot.

######

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

The shoot forward driver lasts 0.25 seconds which can result in unique behaviors, such as briefly curving the shot, or slowing down on impact if shot into a surface with collision enabled at short range.

Adds 0 - 1 memory to your expression parameters (See **Memory Calculations** for more details).

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> FBT Mode </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to add a toggle to change the gesture control set to include feet control.

######

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

See Advanced Options to select an FBT Mode.

Adds 0 - 1 memory to your expression parameters (See **Memory Calculations** for more details).

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Pilot Mode </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to add a two-axis puppet control for each enabled hand.

The puppet menu, by default, pilots position on the XZ plane: AKA Moving Forward, Moving Backward, Strafing Left, and Strafing Right.

**If you do a Thumbs Up gesture** in either hand while the puppet menu is open, the axes swap to XY controls, replacing Forward and Backward with Up and Down.

Closing the puppet menu will have the ball maintain its position in world space, until you **activate your Rigid Return gesture while the menu is closed**.

*While the piloting is less desynced than your typical constraint based piloting system, it is still not in perfect sync due to Unity Physics in VRC and other network difficulties. Please be aware others may not see the ball in the exact same location you do.*

######

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

The ball orientation will still be constrained to your head, but the ball piloting rotation is only constrained to your head's Y rotation. This means you can turn your head left/right to steer the ball, but the ball will never move up or down unless you Thumbs Up.

Adds 17 - 18 memory to your expression parameters (See **Memory Calculations** for more details).

</details>

</details>

</details>

</blockquote>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Advanced Options </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Write Defaults </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enabling/Disabling this option will enable/disable Write Defaults in all generated animator states for SleightlyBall. 

######

![](https://github.com/JustSleightly/SleightlyBall/raw/main/Documentation/Images/SB%20Write%20Defaults.png)

######

If it says Write Defaults **(Auto)**, then this is handled automatically to match the current Write Defaults of your Animator Controller(s).

######

![](https://github.com/JustSleightly/SleightlyBall/raw/main/Documentation/Images/SB%20Write%20Defaults%20Auto.png)

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

####

<blockquote>

If your relevant Animator Controller(s) are all set to one Write Defaults mode, the **Write Defaults** option will automatically match and be labeled with **(Auto)**.

If the Avatar Descriptor does not contain a custom FX layer and if World Physics is enabled, the **Write Defaults** option will automatically match the Write Defaults mode of the Gesture Layer  and be labeled with **(Auto)**.

If your relevant Animator Controller has a mix of Write Defaults On and Off, a warning will appear and the **Write Defaults** option will not be labeled with **(Auto)**. This option will be available to manually enable/disable, and the generated states will follow the manually set status.

If **World Physics** is enabled and your Gesture and FX Animator Controllers are all set to one Write Defaults mode, but the Write Defaults of the Gesture and FX Animator Controllers are different, a different warning will appear and the **Write Defaults** option will not be labeled with **(Auto)**. This option will be available to manually enable/disable, and the generated states will follow the manually set status.

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Remap Control Gestures </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enabling this feature will allow for the rearrangement of each **Gesture Control** to map to different gestures. If **Simple Control** is enabled, then the definition of a 'simple' gesture can be redefined here as well.

######

![](https://github.com/JustSleightly/SleightlyBall/raw/main/Documentation/Gifs/SB%20Gesture%20Remapping.gif)

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

####

<blockquote>

The 'Simple?' toggle checkboxes only display if **Simple Control** is enabled.

If FBT Mode is enabled, the respective FBT Mode columns will apply.

FBT Mode Complex refers to combo gesturing with the opposite hand.

If **Remap Control Gestures** is disabled, the Gesture Control mapping and Simple Control definitions will generate according to their default configuration regardless of any changes while it is enabled.

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Disable Facial Anims </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to force your facial expressions to maintain their defaults while a ball mode is enabled, regardless of activated gesture.

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

All blendshapes that exist on your Viseme Mesh set in your Avatar Descriptor are animated to the values they were set to at the time of generating SleightlyBall. Blendshapes starting with 'vrc.' are ignored.

As this only accounts for blendshapes, please be wary of any non-blendshape animation properties that are triggered on gesture (eye movement, tongue toggles, etc.)

Enabling this feature but not using Viseme Blendshapes mode or having a Viseme Mesh assigned in your Avatar Descriptor will yield an error.

This also affects **Ball Demo** if it is included.

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Force Gesture Tracking </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to force VRC Tracking Control to set fingers to Tracking rather than Animation while a ball mode is enabled. This is only relevant to VR controllers that use finger tracking (ex. Valve Knuckles) on Avatars that use animation overrides on finger tracking.

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

This also affects **Ball Demo** if it is included.

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Include Ball Demo Mode </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable this feature to toggle default Unity Spheres that follow the ball's gesture control. This is often only used for either troubleshooting, demonstration, or practice purposes.

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

####

<blockquote>

If **Disable Facial Anims** is enabled, Demo Mode will also disable facial animations.

If **Force Gesture Tracking** is enabled, Demo Mode will also force gesture tracking.

Adds 0 - 1 memory to your expression parameters (See **Memory Calculations** for more details).

</details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Enable Move Or Copy </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Enable the ability to Move ball input sources from their respective location in the hierarchy rather than Copy them. This is typically used when trying to maintain specific component references that would otherwise break when instantiated via Copy.

######

![](https://github.com/JustSleightly/SleightlyBall/raw/main/Documentation/Images/SB%20Move%20Or%20Copy.png)

######

<details>

  <summary>Technical Details</summary>

######

<blockquote>

Balls are set to Copy by default, and will behave as Copy when this option is disabled.

Ball Inputs from the project assets rather than the hierarchy cannot be set to Move and will revert to Copy.

Using the same Ball source for multiple inputs and setting them to Move will yield an error, as you cannot move one object into two locations.

Using the same Ball source for multiple inputs and setting one to Move and the others to copy, will instantiate the copies first during generation, before moving the remaining one.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Is SleightlyBall compatible with VRChat Quest Avatars? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**No**, as [VRChat Quest Avatars](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/quest-content-limitations) do not support Physics Objects (Rigidbodies, Joints, Colliders) nor Constraints at this time. Other sprint joint ball systems shouldn't be compatible either.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Is SleightlyBall compatible with Optimized Avatars? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**Depends**. The system itself only contributes to the Physics Rigidbodies count, and Physics Colliders if **World Physics** is enabled. This generates 3 - 5 Rigidbodies and 2 - 4 Colliders, which will pull your Avatar down to at least [Medium/Poor](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/avatar-performance-ranking-system). Any other stat reductions are dependent on what balls you choose to use alongside this system.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Why can't other players see my SleightlyBall system in game / Why is it spazzing out?</strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

This is a known issue if the other player has mods in VRChat. So far, I've confirmed and tested the AvatarHider mod to be one cause, but some clients with avatar hiding features work fine, so this is particular to just the MelonLoader standalone mod. There may be other mods that cause this issue. This is mostly out of my control, as this has to do with the current VRChat World Physics fix, and will hopefully be resolved by the upcoming Avatar Dynamics update. I'm slowly looking into the possibility of remedying it but don't be too hopeful since mods aren't technically my problem. If you or your friend have this issue and want to still use AvatarHider without this issue, you can rollback to [this](https://github.com/loukylor/VRC-Mods/releases/download/AH-1.2.6/AvatarHider.dll) version of AvatarHider, just make sure you don't have an automatic mod updater.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> None of my toggles work anymore! HELP?</strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

If you have included World Physics, this may occur if you rearrange the layers in your Gesture Playable Layer of your Avatar Descriptor. If these layers' order is shifted, you must run **VRLabs' [Fix Order](https://github.com/VRLabs/VRChat-Avatars-3.0#fix-order)** script to resolve the sub-animator. Alternatively, you can re-generate the **SleightlyBall** system.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Can I edit/swap the balls after I generate SleightlyBall? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**Yes**, expand the SB_SleightlyBall hierarchy until you reach the Left/Right Ball Modes. You can replace any child to the Ball Mode objects, just remember to leave those child objects enabled, as your animations toggle the Ball Modes on/off.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Can I add audio to the balls? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**Yes!** You can actually **shoot and throw audio sources** with this system! There is currently no built-in audio source generation, as I've long thought about implementing it but it gets extremely cluttered UI-wise given the multi-ball support already. The easiest way to add audio to your balls would be to add the audio source to the ball before you add it to the installer as an input. The audio sources will then toggle on automatically whenever you toggle that respective ball on.

As for extending audio functionality, such as independently toggleable audio, controllable audio settings, etc, at the moment you will have to add those in yourself until there is enough demand for me to implement it. I have a UI in mind that wouldn't require any additional memory, but it wouldn't have as much customization as I'd prefer.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> How do I fix Disable Facial Anims to also disable non-blendshapes (Tongues/Eyes)? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Navigate through your project files to your Avatar's GeneratedSBResources folder and locate the animation clip for *Disable Facial Animations* in the Animations folder. You can add extra properties to this clip to account for resetting your non-blendshape animations.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> How do I fly up/down in Pilot Mode? How do I reset the ball after using Pilot Mode? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

If you do a **Thumbs Up gesture** in either hand while the puppet menu is open, the axes swap to XY controls, replacing Forward and Backward with Up and Down.

Closing the puppet menu will have the ball maintain its position in world space, until you activate your **Rigid Return gesture** while the menu is closed.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> How do I export SleightlyBall with my commercial package? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Assuming you have a **commercial license** for SleightlyBall, the script generates everything from scratch, making it easy to export without worrying about conflicting with other packages.

You can find these generated resources at ***Save File Path**/GeneratedSBResources/*. By default, this is *Assets/JustSleightly/SleightlyBall/GeneratedSBResources/*.

The folder with your avatar's SleightlyBall under Generated Resources is the only one you need to export, aside from the files of the actual balls you used with the tool. The only exception to this is if you did not have an FX controller, Gesture controller, Expression Parameters, or Expressions Menu by default, in which those will be generated in your _Assets/_ folder.

**You may not** export or redistribute the _SleightlyBall.dll_ file under *Assets/JustSleightly/SleightlyBall/Resources/*. Please refer to the full Terms Of Use on my [store](https://store.sleightly.dev/).
